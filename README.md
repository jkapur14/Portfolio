Bitcoin Mining Company Analysis

MGS 314 Final Project

Overview

This project analyzes the performance of three publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies: Cipher Mining (CIFR), TeraWulf (WULF), and Bitfarms (BITF). Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and data from the Yahoo Finance API, I performed a comprehensive analysis of stock performance over the past five years, including moving averages, volume trends, and momentum analysis. The goal was to provide actionable insights into the companies’ volatility, growth potential, and long-term investment opportunities.

Companies Analyzed

Cipher Mining (CIFR) – New York, with large operations in Texas
Industrial-scale Bitcoin mining with low-cost power and large data centers. High volatility tied to Bitcoin cycles.

TeraWulf (WULF) – Easton, Maryland
Focused on sustainable energy (nuclear, hydro) and expanding into high-performance computing (HPC), offering more stability than traditional miners.

Bitfarms (BITF) – Toronto, Canada
Long-operating public miner with vertically integrated operations across multiple countries. Cyclical performance supported by diversified operations.

My Contributions

Collected and cleaned historical stock data using the Yahoo Finance API

Performed data analysis with Pandas, including moving averages and volume trends

Created visualizations with Matplotlib to highlight stock patterns, cycles, and momentum

Generated insights to support investment decisions based on trends and volatility

Note: Other team members contributed to the written report, but all coding, analysis, and visualizations were completed by me.

Key Findings

CIFR: Strong momentum in 2024–2025, consolidating around $17–$20. High-risk, high-reward investment.

WULF: Stable, consistent growth with clean energy initiatives and new HPC partnerships. Reliable medium-risk investment.

BITF: Positive recent movement above its 100-day moving average. Long-term hold with potential from HPC expansion.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python and data analytics can be used to interpret complex financial behavior, especially in volatile industries like cryptocurrency mining. By analyzing trends, volume, and moving averages, I was able to extract actionable insights that simplify investment decision-making. This repository showcases my ability to handle data collection, processing, visualization, and analysis end-to-end.
